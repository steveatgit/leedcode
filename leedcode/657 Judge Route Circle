Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false


class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int v = 0;
        int h = 0;
        for(char ch : moves) {  //equal to     for(int i=0;i<moves.size();i++) {char ch=moves[i];}
            switch(ch) {
                case 'U':
                    v++;
                    break;
                case 'D':
                    v--;
                    break;
                case 'L':
                    h++;
                    break;
                case 'R':
                    h--;
                    break;
            }
        }
        return v==0 && h == 0;
    }
};
